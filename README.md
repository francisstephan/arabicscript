# arabicscript

An easy way to use your latin keyboard to type in arabic script.

A port to elm language of farsiscript (written with clojurescript) and pashtoscript (written with scalajs)

## Usage

Refer to the tables of correspondence to type the desired chars.

After a time this will become quite natural, and you will no longer need to refer to the tables.
